"""Who draws the pointer's path, and how long one movement may take.

⛔ A DECISION BOTH WRAPPERS MAKE THE SAME WAY, so it is made here. `humanize=`
keeps the meaning it has always had on invisible_playwright's constructor -
falsy disables humanising, `True` enables it with the default cap, a number
enables it with that cap in seconds - and invisible_selenium's constructor
takes the same argument with the same meaning. The prefs handed to the browser
depend on the answer, so two wrappers answering differently would launch two
different browsers for the same seed.

What is NOT here is how a wrapper checks that its own path generator can run:
invisible_playwright's has to patch the vendored client's bindings, which is
Playwright's business, and hands that check in as `python_available`.
