"""Command-line interface for invisible_selenium.

TWO COMMANDS, and that is the whole surface.

It was six: fetch, fetch --force, path, version, clear-cache, doctor. Every one
of them was a step somebody had to know to take, in a package whose entire
promise is that the browser handles itself. The ones that are gone did not lose
their behaviour, they lost their command:

  doctor       every cached engine is checked against the seal by `fetch`, on
               every run. It was the thing most worth doing and the thing least
               likely to be typed, which is the worst combination a subcommand
               can have.
  --force      unnecessary once `fetch` verifies: a tree that does not match the
               seal is replaced because it does not match, not because a flag was
               passed.
  path         `fetch` prints the resolved path as its last line, so
               `$(invisible-selenium fetch)` is the scripting form and it also
               guarantees the thing it names actually exists. `path` promised a
               path and could hand back one to a tree that was wrong.
  clear-cache  deliberately NOT folded in. The cache root belongs to
               invisible_core and not to this package, so pruning "trees no
               seal points at" would delete an engine this package did not put
               there. It was written for invisible_firefox, whose repository
               was deleted on 2026-08-18 while the package stayed on the index,
               so an installed copy still shares that root - and the reason
               holds for anything else built on the core.
               `version` prints the cache location; removing a directory is a
               thing a person can do without a subcommand for it.

The `tag` argument went with them. The seal decides which engine this build runs
and `verify_engine` refuses anything else, so a tag on the command line could
only ever name something that would then be rejected.
