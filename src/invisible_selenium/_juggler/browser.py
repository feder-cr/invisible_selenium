#: receives it, so this adds no plumbing; `launch` takes the key back out
#: before writing `user.js`, so it never reaches a profile.
#:
#: ⛔ THE SEED CROSSES, NOT A PERSONA, and the second consumer is what settled
#: it. This carried a ready-made `TypingPersona` while the keyboard was the
#: only thing that wanted a rhythm. Then the click wanted one too, from a
#: DIFFERENT persona drawn from the same seed, and a transport carrying one
#: built object would have had to grow a second field - then a third. What is
#: actually session-scoped is the seed; a persona is something you build where
#: you use it.
#:
#: ⛔ NOT under `stealthfox.*`. That prefix means "the patched binary reads
#: this", and a reader who found this key there would go looking in C++ for
#: something answered in Python. The `server` in the name is historical: the

#: right value and the wrong type. The cap is decided once, by the launcher,
