"""The connection to Juggler: the pipe, with no Node in between.

THE CONTRACT, read from `juggler/pipe/nsRemoteDebuggingPipe.cpp` and not
guessed:

  - messages are JSON delimited by a ZERO BYTE, not a newline
    (`ReaderLoop` accumulates until it finds `'\\0'`);
  - on POSIX the descriptors are **hardwired to 3 and 4**: `const int
    readFD = 3; const int writeFD = 4;`. They are not negotiated;
  - on Windows there are NO descriptors: they are HANDLEs read from the
    environment, `GetEnvironmentVariableA("PW_PIPE_READ", ...)` plus
    `atoi`, so the value must be passed in DECIMAL and the handle must be
    made inheritable;
  - the names are from the BROWSER's point of view: its `PW_PIPE_READ` is
    what IT reads from, i.e. where WE write.

⛔ And the flag `-juggler-pipe` must appear on the command line, or on
Windows the handles never get armed at all and the pipe breaks at the
launcher -> parent transition.

⛔ THE READINESS SIGNAL DOES NOT TRAVEL OVER THE PIPE. The browser prints
`Juggler listening to the pipe` on stdout, and that line comes out of a
`dump()` that a `MOZILLA_OFFICIAL` build disables: a disabled `dump()`
RETURNS SUCCESSFULLY without writing. The fix lives in the Firefox source
(`30-upstream-playwright-patches.md`), not here. Anyone reading a long
timeout at launch should look there first.

State: first piece. Opens the connection, sends commands, receives
responses and events. Not yet a client: no lifecycle, no frames, no
actionability.

    closed with a nameless error - `the pipe closed`, `the pipe is closed` -
    which `parse_error` turned into the fork's plain `Error`. The same fact,
    the browser is gone, reached a caller as two different classes, and the
    caller that had to tell "the page refused" from "the browser died" (the
    AIHawk server's retry) was reduced to matching the sentences. Measured

    ⛔ WHY IT EXISTS, measured on 2026-09-25 ([B229]). The two streams go into
    one pipe, and it used to be read only until the readiness line and never
    again. A pipe has a fixed buffer - the Windows default, since it is created
    with size 0 - so once Firefox had written a buffer's worth after startup,
    its next write BLOCKED, and so did whichever of its threads was writing.
    Forced with `devtools.console.stdout.content`: a page logging 2 KB still
    answered, one logging 8 KB never answered again, with 5085 bytes sitting
    unread in the pipe. The browser stayed alive and silent, with no error
    anywhere. Ordinary browsing on Windows writes little (76 bytes over ten
    real sites), which is why it went unseen: it is a clock that runs out in
    long sessions, on Linux where GTK and fontconfig talk, or with any log on.

    ⛔ ONE READER, NOT A SECOND ONE ADDED AFTER THE FIRST. Readiness is a
    question asked of this object (`wait_for_ready`), not a loop of its own on
    the same stream: two readers of one pipe split its lines between them.

    The kept lines are the only account of why a browser stopped. They were
    already what a failed STARTUP printed; now the same lines are there when
    the pipe closes in the middle of a session (`Connection.send`).

    caller's own desktop otherwise. That variable is consumed HERE and does
    not reach the browser: the engine never reads it.

    Everything else is what the `Popen` call used to do, made explicit:
    exactly five handles are inherited - the two Juggler pipe ends, the
    child's end of the stdout pipe, a second handle to that same end for
    stderr, and the read end of a pipe for stdin - through
    `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST`, so a second session starting in the
    same instant cannot hand its pipe ends to this browser and lose the
    ability to notice its own closing. `bInheritHandles=TRUE` with that list
    inherits those five and nothing else.

    ⛔ THE THREE STD HANDLES ARE SHAPED FOR FIREFOX'S LAUNCHER, and the first
    draft of this function got two of them wrong. `firefox.exe` runs first as
    a launcher that creates the real browser with a handle list of its own,
    built from its stdin, stdout and stderr plus the Juggler pipe
    (`browser/app/winlauncher/LauncherProcessWin.cpp`, `ProcThreadAttributes.h`).
    That list takes only DISK and PIPE handles, silently drops anything else
    while still naming it as a std handle, and is never de-duplicated - and
    Windows refuses a handle list with the same handle twice. A NUL device for
    stdin (a CHAR handle) and one handle for both stdout and stderr made the
    launcher's `CreateProcessW` fail with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (Event Log,
    `LauncherProcessWin.cpp:580`); the launcher then disabled itself for that
    path in the registry (`|Browser` = 0) and ran on as the browser itself,
    so the session worked and `tests/test_first_launch_from_a_new_path.py`
    was the only thing that saw it. `Popen` never tripped it because CPython
    duplicates every std handle separately. So: stdin is the read end of a
    pipe whose write end is closed at once (EOF, and a PIPE type), and stderr
    is its own duplicate of the stdout pipe.

    This leg was written from `nsRemoteDebuggingPipe.cpp` and never executed

    `Juggler listening to the pipe`, stays alive - and the very first write
    raises `BrokenPipeError`. A live process with no reader on the other end.

    ⛔ THE CAUSE, MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED. CPython's close-all-fds
    sweep runs AFTER `preexec_fn`, so the two descriptors this function creates
    with `dup2` are closed again before `exec` unless they are in the keep

        with 3 and 4 also kept                          ->  alive=[3, 4]

    Fd 3 survived only by accident: the first `os.pipe()` in the parent
    happened to return 3, so it was already in the keep list and the `dup2`
    onto it was a no-op. Fd 4 was created by `dup2` and swept away - which is
    why the browser could ANNOUNCE itself (it had a read end on 3) and never
    receive anything (nothing owned the read end of OUR pipe once 4 died).

    ⛔ The remedy is to name 3 and 4 in `pass_fds` as well. They are not open
    in the parent and do not have to be: that list is a set of NUMBERS the
