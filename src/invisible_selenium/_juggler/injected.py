"""The injected script, called from Python.

⛔ THIS MODULE REIMPLEMENTS NOTHING, and the reason is that it could not:
selector engines and actionability work on the DOM, and Python is not in
the page. JavaScript stays JavaScript; this file only handles loading it
into the right world and calling it.

THE TWO WORLDS, which are the reason for this entire file. Firefox gives
automation a separate context that sees the same DOM **through an Xray**:
inside it `addEventListener`, `textContent` and `querySelector` are the
NATIVE ones, not the ones the site may have replaced. In the MAIN world
everything belongs to the site, and every read is accountable to whoever
wrapped the accessor. On 2026-08-27 two spots that used the wrong world
produced 13 listeners plus one `textContent` read for every
`bounding_box()`: see `31-client-fork.md` §3.9 and §3.10.

**Rule: this file ALWAYS works in the utility world.**

HOW IT IS CREATED. There is no "create a world" command: you send
`Page.setInitScripts` with an **empty** script and a `worldName`, and
Juggler announces the context with `Runtime.executionContextCreated`,
whose `auxData.name` carries that name. ⛔ The name is `__ctx_aux__` and
**is not the upstream one**: our fork renamed it because it used to
travel on the page's window (`31-client-fork.md` §3.5). Changing it here
without changing it there breaks the hookup silently.

        ⛔ THIS IS A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM UPSTREAM PLAYWRIGHT, and it is
        the whole point of owning the client. Upstream serialises with
        `documentElement.outerHTML`, which walks the light DOM only: every
        shadow root, open or closed, comes back as an empty host element. A
        `content()` that silently omits half the document is the defect, not
        the contract - and closed roots are exactly where the interesting parts
        of a hostile page live.

        **HOW, and every piece was measured on the shipped engine on
        2026-08-27:**

        - `Element.getHTML({serializableShadowRoots, shadowRoots})` exists here
          and serialises a root as `<template shadowrootmode="closed">`. It only
          serialises roots it is HANDED, or ones the page marked `serializable`,
          so the list has to be collected first.
        - Collecting them is possible because this runs in the UTILITY world,
          where `element.shadowRoot` answers for a closed root too. That is our
          C++ patch in `Element::GetShadowRootForBindings`, gated on the
          ExpandedPrincipal, so the PAGE still gets `null` and nothing about
          this is observable from content. Measured both ways in the same run.
        - The walk is recursive: a shadow root can contain hosts of its own,
          and stopping at depth one would produce a document that looks
          complete and is not.

        On the probe page: 508 characters against 433 for the `outerHTML` path,
        and the closed root's text is present in the first and absent in the
        second.

        ⛔ NO FALLBACK. If `getHTML` is missing the call raises, and that is
        correct: this package pins its own engine through the seal, so a
        missing `getHTML` means the engine is not the one we pinned, and
        quietly returning a document with holes in it would hide that.
