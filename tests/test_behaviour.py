"""Unit tests for the macro pointer-behaviour planner (`_behaviour`).

Everything here is arithmetic on a planned timeline. No browser is launched,
no page is loaded, nothing sleeps: the planner is pure by design precisely so
that its statistical properties can be asserted instead of eyeballed.

The four properties under test map one-to-one onto the four things a
behavioural classifier can measure about a pointer stream:

  1. reproducibility  - one seed replays exactly, two seeds look like two
                        different hands (nothing is a package-wide constant).
  2. bounds           - no coordinate leaves the viewport, no delay is
                        physically impossible, no zero-displacement event.
  3. distribution     - pauses are heavy-tailed, movement time depends on
                        distance and target size, the speed peak is in the
                        middle of the movement and the jitter is zero-mean.
  4. occupancy        - the pointer is actually in motion for a materially
                        larger share of the session than the ~4% that
                        motivated this work, and its movements do not all
                        terminate on a control.
