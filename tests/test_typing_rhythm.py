"""The keyboard has an owner of its rhythm, drawn from the session seed.

⛔ WHAT IT REPLACES. A keypress went out as two protocol messages back to back,
so a page saw `keydown` and `keyup` about 2.4 ms apart and two characters about
5 ms apart, against the 60-250 ms a hand produces. It is the cheapest tell there
is: a site does not have to probe for it, only to listen, and a password field
is where that listening is already installed.

`delay=` was never the fix. The server dropped it on six of the seven paths that
accept it, and even honoured it would be a constant the caller picked, so every
install passing `delay=100` would share one rhythm. That is the linkage key
`19-cursor-signature.md` is about, moved from the pointer to the keyboard.
