"""`goto` on a page that replaces itself from script while it loads.

The known-bad input of [B228], measured on 2026-09-25: YouTube
(`?themeRefresh=1`) and Reddit (a JavaScript challenge) start a new navigation
after ours has committed. Our navigation never reaches `load`, because its
document is gone, and `goto` used to wait for it until the timeout: 45 s on a
page that was ready, while stock Playwright answered in 2 to 4 s on the same
Firefox 151. Every `browser_navigate` of the MCP server to such a site was a
45-second failure.

This is the same shape without depending on anybody's site: a local page whose
`<head>` calls `location.replace` before `load`. The unit half, the ordering
of navigations, is in `test_juggler_lifecycle.py`.
