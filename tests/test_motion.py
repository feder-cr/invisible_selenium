"""Statistical tests for the cursor motion planner.

Everything here runs offline, on the trajectory function itself, with plain
arithmetic - no browser, no network, no filesystem. That is the whole point of
having the generator in Python: its statistics can be asserted in CI.

The file also carries a faithful copy of the *legacy in-engine* generator (the
one that lives in the browser and expands a single mousemove into a Bezier path
of its own). It is here for one reason: a gate that has only ever printed PASS
is not a gate.

TWO CONVENTIONS THIS FILE ENFORCES STRUCTURALLY
-----------------------------------------------
**One assertion, used twice.** Every check that a known-bad generator can be
*fed* is factored into a named ``check_*`` function, and that same function is
called both by the forward test and by a ``..._rejects_...`` test that requires
it to raise. Writing the assertion once for each arm is how the two arms drift
apart and how a check quietly stops discriminating.

**A rate that must not be exactly zero is asserted as a BAND, and the band is
proved at both ends.** "This never happens" is itself a signature. A generator
whose paths backtrack in 0.000% of cases, or repeat a device pixel in 0.000% of
cases, is exactly as recognisable as one that always drifts +0.5 px: both are an
exact invariant shared by every install. So those checks assert a plausible
interval and have TWO known-bad arms - one that never does the thing, one that
does it far too much.

WHICH CHECKS DISCRIMINATE, AND AGAINST WHAT
-------------------------------------------
There are two known-bad generators in play and they are not the same thing. The
LEGACY one is the in-engine expander transcribed below. The PREVIOUS one is the
immediately preceding revision of ``_motion`` itself - the state an independent
verification measured, which had fixed the legacy's drift and introduced its own
defects. Where a check only rejects one of the two, this table says which.

    assert_zero_mean                  legacy jitter is drawn with mu = 1, so
                                      its mean residual is ~ +0.50 px
    check_both_axes_carry_noise       legacy jitters y only; sd(x) is exactly 0.
                                      Rejects PREVIOUS on axis-ALIGNED
                                      movements, where its travel-normal tremor
                                      left sd(x) at exactly 0 - and passes it on
                                      a diagonal, correctly, because there the
                                      tremor did reach both axes. The check is
                                      run on all three orientations for exactly
                                      that reason.
    check_tremor_is_two_dimensional   legacy displacements are all parallel to
                                      one screen axis, so the cloud has one
                                      eigenvalue. Rejects PREVIOUS on every
                                      orientation: sd(along)/sd(across) was
                                      7.1e-14.
    check_not_predictable             legacy x is a cubic at a uniform
                                      parameter, so a cubic through four
                                      neighbours recovers the fifth exactly.
                                      Rejects PREVIOUS per-axis on axis-aligned
                                      movements (median x error 0.025 px on a
                                      horizontal move, against 0.24 px now).
    check_every_waypoint_is_displaced rejects PREVIOUS, which displaced a random
                                      SUBSET and so left 36% of the interior
                                      waypoints sitting exactly on the analytic
                                      curve.
    check_peak_distribution           legacy's median peak sits at ~2% of the
                                      movement; also rejects a peak position
                                      that is the same number every time. Does
                                      NOT reject PREVIOUS: its profile was
                                      already bell-shaped and already per
                                      movement. This check guards that, it did
                                      not repair it.
    check_detour_is_a_few_percent     legacy travels ~4.3x the straight-line
                                      distance on a sub-50 px move
    check_duration_grows_with_distance
                                      legacy takes 1003 ms for 25 px and
                                      1003 ms for 1200 px
    check_backtrack_rate              BOTH ends: a strictly monotone planner -
                                      which PREVIOUS was, 0.000000 on every one
                                      of 12000 paths - and the legacy generator
                                      (mean 0.045, p95 0.22)
    check_duplicate_rate              BOTH ends: a planner that filters every
                                      repeat, which PREVIOUS did, and the legacy
                                      generator (8% of events, and a 3+ run on
                                      EVERY movement)
    check_shape_diverges              rejects PREVIOUS at 1.08 / 1.05 / 1.05 for
                                      50 / 200 / 600 px, and rejects the
                                      synthetic case of handing every seed the
                                      same style

Two checks do NOT discriminate against either generator, and naming them is the
point of this list:

  * the implied-speed envelope. Legacy's median mean-speed is ~495 px/s and its
    maximum ~1270 px/s - both comfortably inside a human envelope. It passes.
    That check is a plausibility floor and ceiling, not a discriminator, and it
    has no known-bad arm.
  * the velocity-profile spread. Measured as an arc-length profile, the legacy
    generator varies a great deal (interior sd 0.03-0.14) because its control
    knots are random, so it passes that check too. What is actually frozen in
    the legacy generator is its time MAP, and that is a different quantity;
    ``test_legacy_velocity_profile_is_effectively_frozen`` pins the time map
    directly and is the known-bad evidence for this property.

Everything else here is structural - endpoints exact, provable bounding box,
step-count envelope, module purity, seed reproducibility, style ranges. The
legacy generator has no seed, no style and no per-session anything, so there is
nothing to feed those; they are absent from the list above and claim no
known-bad arm.

# style ranges, derived from the source rather than restated
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# An earlier version of this test copied every draw range out of
# ``style_for_seed`` and re-asserted it with ad-hoc padding (the module drew
# bow_frac from 0.008..0.045 and the test allowed 0.005..0.05). Written from
# the same head as the code, on the same day, it could not catch a range
# change: widen a range in the module and the padded copy still passes;
# narrow it and nothing notices either. It restated the numbers, it did not
# check them.
#
# What replaces it is two things that cannot be written from memory:
#
#   * the ranges are PARSED out of ``style_for_seed`` and each field is
#     checked against its own draw call. A range change in the module is a
#     range change in the test, automatically, with no second copy to update.
#     The draws must also FILL the parsed range, which is what catches a value
#     that is drawn wide and then silently clamped narrow somewhere else.
#   * the fields that are not a direct draw (they are computed from locals)
#     are checked as PROPERTIES - orderings, and the mathematical requirement
#     that the Beta speed density have both shape parameters above 1 so speed
#     is zero at both ends. No number from the module appears in them.
#
# Every dataclass field must fall into one of those two arms, so a new field
# cannot be added without a decision about how it is checked.
