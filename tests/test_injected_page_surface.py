"""The injected bundle must not touch the page's window. Ever, in any phase.

⛔ WHY THIS IS A CLASS AND NOT A LIST OF NAMES. Four tells were found in this
bundle one at a time, each fixed on its own: two CustomEvents dispatched before
every action (removed), an enumerable `window.builtins` (turned off), a
`__playwright_mark_target__` rename, and a `__ctx_ping__` the constructor
dispatched on the page's window to learn whether its listeners had been wiped.
The fourth survived all three earlier passes, because each fix knew about its
own symbol and nothing knew about the shape they shared.

So this gate never looks for a name. It RUNS the bundle against a window and a
document that record every access, and asserts ONE property:

    constructing the script, checking a hit target, and having the page rewrite
    itself all touch the page's window zero times.

⛔ THIS USED TO BE THREE PROPERTIES, and the collapse is the news. While the
hit-target check was an INTERCEPTOR it had to put capture listeners on the
page's window for the duration of each action, so the best that could be asked
was that it removed exactly what it added and added no more than it needed. The
check is a pure DOM read now, so there is nothing to balance: the number is
zero everywhere, which is a statement two symmetry assertions could never make.

The measurement lives in `tests/gates/injected_page_surface.js`, which also
documents what the harness can and cannot model.
