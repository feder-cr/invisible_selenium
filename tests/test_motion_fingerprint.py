"""The paths must not move without somebody deciding they should.

Seed-reproducibility is a documented property callers rely on
(``InvisiblePlaywright(seed=42)``), and it is invisible to the statistical
tests next door: they check distributions, and a refactor that shifts every
coordinate leaves every distribution intact.

WHAT IS PINNED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE RAW FLOATS
------------------------------------------------
The first version of this file hashed ``round(x, 10)`` - float64, essentially
verbatim - and it went red on GitHub on three runners out of four while passing
locally. Measured rather than guessed, by running the identical grid on Windows
and on Linux:

  * on the SAME Python, 1 case out of 576 differs, with the same waypoint
    count. A last-bit libm difference in one coordinate, at one input;
  * hashing the INTEGER PIXELS instead, the two platforms are byte-identical.

Which settles what the promise can honestly be. A pointer event carries integer
coordinates: that sub-bit disagreement is not observable by a page, by a
detector or by a user - it exists only in a float nobody dispatches. Pinning it
was pinning an implementation detail of libm, and a gate that cannot be green on
a supported platform is a gate somebody eventually deletes.

So this pins what actually reaches the wire: the rounded pixel, the
millisecond, and the number of events. That is the level the product promises
and the level a regression would be felt at.

WHAT IT STILL CATCHES, WHICH IS THE POINT
-----------------------------------------
Extracting the planner into stages looked completely safe and changed the
output twice, both times through float multiplication not being associative:

  * ``axis.at(dist * u, ...)`` computes ``ux * (dist * u)`` where the original
    wrote ``ux * dist * u``, i.e. ``(ux * dist) * u``;
  * returning ``amp * w`` from the overshoot and multiplying by the unit vector
    at the call site regrouped the same product.

Both moved rounded pixels, not merely last bits, so both are still caught here.
Reordering a draw from the rng, or adding one, moves the counts - which is why
the count digest is asserted separately: it is integer-valued, so no platform
explains it away, and it fails first with a clearer message.

If this goes red the question is not "which constant do I update". It is "did I
mean to change every path of every session", and the answer is almost always no.
