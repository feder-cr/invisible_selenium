"""One call to `click` presses once, whatever the press does to the page.

⛔ THIS IS THE DEFECT, AND IT WAS MEASURED ON THE PUBLISHED 0.22.0 BEFORE IT WAS
UNDERSTOOD. Three buttons on one page, differing only in what their handler
does, thirty calls each, with the page counting the clicks it received:

    does nothing        30 calls -> 30 clicks, 30 reported success
    moves itself        30 calls -> 30 clicks, 30 reported success
    hides itself        30 calls -> 1068 clicks, 30 reported FAILURE

and, on the interface's own sessions panel, one call opened it and closed it
again - two complete gestures 167 ms apart - and reported success.

The cause is not in `click`. `_act_on_target` used to read the hit target again
AFTER the press and raise `WrongHitTarget` on what it found, and `_retry`
absorbs that exception by starting over. Starting over presses again. The
observation it raised on cannot distinguish a click that missed from a click
that worked and moved the control out from under the pointer, so on every
control whose effect changes what is under the pointer, the loop repeated a
thing it cannot un-do.

`test_hit_target_check.py` holds the unit shape - one read, between approach and
press. This holds the consequence on the real path, because that is the part a
reader cares about: a press is not idempotent and must happen once.
