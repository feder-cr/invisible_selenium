"""The reaper: does it kill our tree, and does it leave everything else alone.

These use REAL processes rather than mocks. The bug being fixed is about what
the operating system does with a re-parented process tree, and a mock of
psutil would only ever confirm that the code calls the functions it calls -
which is not the thing in doubt. Short-lived `python -c "sleep"` children stand
in for the browser: what matters is that they carry an inherited environment
block, and they do.

The negative case is the important one. A reaper that kills everything passes
every positive test ever written.
