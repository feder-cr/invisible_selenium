"""The delivery discipline, driven by a clock that does what the test says.

⛔ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. These rules used to be a loop inside `_cursor._dispatch`
and were only ever exercised through it. They now live in `_pacing` so the
server's drag can obey them too, and an extraction is exactly the kind of change
that keeps every existing test green while quietly altering a decision. So the
decisions are asserted here directly, against a clock the test owns.

Every test below drives the pacer by hand, which is what the two real drivers do
- one with `await`, one without - so a rule proved here is proved for both.
