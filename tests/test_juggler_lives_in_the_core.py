"""The Juggler client lives once, in invisible_core.juggler.

Until 0.3.0 this package carried its own copy, taken from invisible_playwright
on 2026-09-24, and so did the other wrappers, and a fix reached one client and
not the others: five remedies of the Playwright wrapper never reached this
copy, and the one guard the selenium copy had never reached the wrapper
(decision D85).
A file here with the name of a core module is that copy coming back, whatever
it contains, so the test is on the CLASS - the name - and not on the content.
