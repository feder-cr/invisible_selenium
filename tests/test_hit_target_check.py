"""The hit target is checked once, after the approach and before the press.

⛔ IT USED TO BE AN INTERCEPTOR, and then two pure reads, and this file exists
because of what the SECOND read cost. The bundle once installed capture
listeners on the page's window and blocked events whose point had stopped
belonging to the element; that was a tell, because a real `mousedown` that
vanishes under `preventDefault` is not something an input stack produces. It
was replaced by a read before the action and a read after it, and the one after
turned "the target moved" into a retry.

⛔ THE READ AFTER CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTION IT WAS ASKED. Once the event has
gone out, "the point stopped belonging to the element" is the same observation
for a click that missed and for a click that worked and moved the control out
from under the pointer - and the second is most controls, not an edge case.
Measured on the published 0.22.0, one call each: a button that hides itself on
click received THIRTY-NINE clicks and the call reported failure; a panel toggle
was opened and closed by one call, which reported success; a button that only
moves, and one that does nothing, were right thirty times out of thirty.

So there is one read, and it sits between the approach and the press:

  * before the approach is too early - a page that rearranges itself on hover,
    which is what menus do, was being judged in the layout that existed before
    the pointer arrived;
  * after the press is unanswerable, and repeating the press is the one thing a
    retry loop must never do, because it cannot un-press a button.

What is left is one round trip between the read and the press. Closing that one
belongs to the engine, which is the only place that can verify and dispatch
without a gap. It is not closed by reading the DOM again afterwards.

The companion property, that the bundle touches the page's window zero times in
every phase, is measured in `tests/test_injected_page_surface.py`.
